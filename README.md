# @vpremises/vpremises-site

Explain local metadata observation and the management of user-controlled environments.

## What you can do

- Maintain reviewed overview and getting-started content.
- Validate Japanese/English content and preview the configured site.

## Current scope

Documentation does not discover or deploy the reader’s infrastructure. The required localized-site package is referenced as an excluded local archive; a fresh clone cannot install it until an approved distribution path is available. No deployment is performed by these instructions.

## Getting started

The manifest currently requires locally supplied package archives: `@nuxtjp/localized-site`. These archives are excluded from Git. Obtain the exact approved dependency artifacts before installing; a fresh clone alone is not sufficient. Registry distribution remains pending.

Use `pnpm@10.29.3` and the Node.js version declared in `engines` in `package.json`. Run from this repository:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm validate:content
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```
